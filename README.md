Welcome to the repository!

Here, you'll find the R code used to produce the results in the paper:

<i>Chang, C. J., Oâ€™Brien, K. M., Kresovich, J. K., Nwanaji-Enwerem, J. C., Xu, Z., Gaston, S. A., ... & White, A. J. (2024). Associations between use of chemical hair products and epigenetic age: Findings from the Sister Study. Environmental Epidemiology, 8(3), e311.</i>

I hope you find this code helpful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me at che-jung.chang@nih.gov. Your feedback is greatly valued as I am committed to transparent and collaborative research.

All the data necessary to reproduce the analysis are publicly available via request on the Sister Study website: Sister Study Data Requests (https://sisterstudy.niehs.nih.gov/English/data-requests.htm).

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
